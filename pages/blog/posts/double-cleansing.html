                        Double cleansing, a fundamental step in Korean skincare routines, has transformed how we think about facial cleansing. This two-step process, which involves using an oil-based cleanser followed by a water-based cleanser, has been practiced in Korea for centuries.

                    <h2>The Origins of Double Cleansing</h2>
                    <p>
                        The practice of double cleansing can be traced back to the Three Kingdoms period of Korea (57 BC to 935 AD). During this time, women would use plant oils to remove their makeup, followed by rice water to cleanse their skin. This traditional method laid the foundation for modern double cleansing techniques.

                    <h2>Why Two Steps?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The science behind double cleansing is rooted in the principle of "like dissolves like." Oil-based cleansers effectively break down oil-based impurities such as sebum, sunscreen, and makeup. The water-based cleanser then removes water-based impurities like sweat and dirt.

                    <h2>Modern Double Cleansing</h2>
                    <p>
                        Today's double cleansing methods combine traditional wisdom with modern skincare science. Korean beauty brands have developed innovative formulations that make this ancient practice more effective and enjoyable than ever.
